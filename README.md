## How It Works

### 1. Script Parsing

The application uses a custom screenplay parser (`useScriptParser.ts`) that:

- Detects character names (all caps followed by dialogue)
- Extracts dialogue text
- Splits screenplay into processable chunks
- Maintains scene and character context

### 2. Audio Generation Flow

**Without Concatenation:**

```
Parse screenplay → Detect characters → Configure voices → Generate each chunk via ElevenLabs API → Download individual files
```

**With Concatenation:**

```
Parse screenplay → Detect characters → Configure voices → Generate each chunk via ElevenLabs API → Store in memory → Send to backend server → FFmpeg concatenates files → Download single file
```

### 3. Backend Concatenation (Optional)

The backend server (`server/index.js`) provides a REST API endpoint:

- **Endpoint**: `POST /concatenate`
- **Input**: Multipart form data with audio files
- **Process**: Uses ffmpeg's concat demuxer to merge files
- **Output**: Single concatenated MP3 file
- **Cleanup**: Automatically removes temporary files

## Configuration

### Project Settings

- **Model**:

  - `eleven_multilingual_v2` — High quality, multilingual (default)
  - `eleven_monolingual_v1` — High quality, English-only
  - `eleven_multilingual_v1` — Legacy multilingual model
  - `eleven_turbo_v2` — Faster generation with slightly lower fidelity
  - **Custom** — Pick “Custom” in the dropdown and paste any supported model id (e.g. `eleven_flash_v2_5`)

- **Output Format**:

  - `mp3_44100_128` - MP3 at 44.1kHz, 128kbps (default)
  - `mp3_44100_192` - MP3 at 44.1kHz, 192kbps (higher quality)
  - `pcm_24000` - PCM at 24kHz (uncompressed)

- **Concatenate Audio**:
  - `Enabled` - Combines all audio into one file (requires backend server)
  - `Disabled` - Downloads individual files (e.g., `0000_CHARACTER.mp3`)

### Character Voice Settings

Each character can have custom voice settings:

- **Voice ID**: ElevenLabs voice identifier (get from [ElevenLabs Voice Library](https://elevenlabs.io/voices))
- **Stability** (0.0-1.0): Controls voice consistency
- **Similarity Boost** (0.0-1.0): Enhances similarity to original voice
- **Style** (0.0-1.0): Adds expressiveness
- **Speed** (0.25-4.0): Playback speed multiplier

## Screenplay Format

**IMPORTANT**: The parser requires a specific format to work correctly.

### Required Format

```
Characters:
- CHARACTER ONE
- CHARACTER TWO
- CHARACTER THREE

INT. LOCATION - DAY

CHARACTER ONE
First line of dialogue here.

CHARACTER TWO
Response dialogue here.
This can span multiple lines.

CHARACTER ONE
(whispering)
More dialogue with stage direction.
```

### Quick Rules

**Required:**

1. **Start with `Characters:`** - List all characters at the top
2. **Use dashes** - Each character name must start with `-`
3. **ALL CAPS** - Character names must be in ALL CAPS
4. **Match names** - Names in dialogue must match the Characters list

**Optional:**

- Scene headings: `INT.`, `EXT.`, or `I/E.`
- Parentheticals: `(whispering)` - automatically removed from audio
- Inline format: `CHARACTER: dialogue here`

### Working Example

Copy this into the app to test:

```
Characters:
- ALICE
- BOB

ALICE
Hello Bob, how are you?

BOB
I'm great, thanks!

ALICE
That's wonderful to hear.
```

## Troubleshooting

The app includes comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages and troubleshooting steps. Here are common issues and solutions:

### "No dialogue chunks found in script"

**Cause**: The screenplay parser couldn't detect any dialogue

**Solutions**:
1. Add a `Characters:` section at the top with character names using dashes
2. Use ALL CAPS for character names in both the list and dialogue
3. Test with the example from [example.txt](example.txt)
4. See [EXAMPLE_SCREENPLAY.md](EXAMPLE_SCREENPLAY.md) for detailed formatting

**App shows**: Detailed error message with formatting tips and links to examples

### "Failed to concatenate audio" or "Backend Server Not Running"

**Cause**: The concatenation server isn't running

**Solutions**:
1. Start the backend: `cd server && npm start`
2. Or disable "Concatenate Audio" to download individual files
3. Make sure port 3001 is available
4. See [CONCATENATION_SETUP.md](CONCATENATION_SETUP.md) for setup guide

**App shows**: Clear instructions on starting the server or disabling concatenation

### "Invalid API Key" or "401 Unauthorized"

**Cause**: Invalid or expired ElevenLabs API key

**Solutions**:
1. Verify your API key at https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys
2. Make sure you copied the entire key without extra spaces
3. Check if your API key has been revoked or expired
4. Try generating a new API key

**App shows**: Detailed troubleshooting steps and link to API key management

### "Rate Limit Exceeded" or "429 Too Many Requests"

**Cause**: Hit the ElevenLabs API rate limit

**Solutions**:
1. Wait a few minutes - the app automatically retries with delays
2. Consider upgrading your ElevenLabs plan for higher rate limits
3. Process smaller batches of dialogue
4. Check your usage at https://elevenlabs.io/app/usage

**App shows**: Rate limit warning with automatic backoff and wait times

### "Quota Exceeded" or "Insufficient Credits"

**Cause**: Used up your ElevenLabs character quota

**Solutions**:
1. Check remaining quota at https://elevenlabs.io/app/usage
2. Wait until your quota resets (monthly)
3. Upgrade your plan for more characters per month
4. Use shorter dialogue for testing

**App shows**: Quota information and links to usage dashboard

### "No voice configuration found for character: X"

**Cause**: Character doesn't have a voice assigned

**Solutions**:
1. Scroll to Character Config panel
2. Click "Browse Voices" to search and preview voices
3. Select a voice from the dropdown
4. Make sure all characters have voices assigned

**App shows**: Which specific character needs a voice with instructions

### Network or Connection Errors

**Cause**: Unable to connect to ElevenLabs servers

**Solutions**:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try again in a few moments
3. Check if ElevenLabs is down at https://status.elevenlabs.io
4. Disable VPN or proxy if you're using one

**App shows**: Network error details with troubleshooting steps

### Generation Interrupted or Page Refreshed

**Solution**: The app automatically saves progress! Just refresh and click "Resume Generation" to continue where you left off.

**Note**: Progress is saved for 24 hours and includes:
- Which files were generated
- Current position in the screenplay
- Estimated time remaining

- LocalStorage for persistence
- Progress tracking utilities

**Backend:**
- Node.js with Express 4.18.2
- Multer 1.4.5 for file uploads
- Fluent-FFmpeg 2.1.2 for audio processing
- CORS for cross-origin requests

**Testing:**

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory (optional):

```bash
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

If not set, you'll be prompted to enter it in the UI.

## Development

### Run in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Run tests:

```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# Unit tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Unit tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Unit coverage snapshot
npx vitest run --config vitest.config.unit.ts --coverage
```

> Playwright E2E tests currently mock ElevenLabs API responses so they can run offline. Run `npx playwright install` once to fetch browsers, and update the tests/config if you add scenarios that hit the real service.

### Project Scripts:

- `npm run dev` - Start development server (localhost:3000)
- `npm run build` - Build for production (outputs to `/dist`)
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm test` - Run unit tests once
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with Vitest UI
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run Playwright E2E tests

## API Rate Limits

ElevenLabs API has rate limits based on your subscription tier:

- **Free**: 10,000 characters/month
- **Starter**: 30,000 characters/month
- **Creator**: 100,000 characters/month
- **Pro**: 500,000 characters/month

The app includes automatic rate limiting (500ms delay between requests) to avoid hitting API limits.

## Current Limitations

1. **Browser-based Generation**: Audio generation happens client-side, which consumes bandwidth for large scripts
2. **Backend Required for Concatenation**: Merging audio files requires the backend server with FFmpeg
3. **ElevenLabs API Only**: Currently only supports ElevenLabs (no other TTS providers)
4. **Sequential Processing**: Files generated one at a time to respect API rate limits (parallel generation would hit rate limits)
5. **LocalStorage Only**: Multi-user support is basic and doesn't sync across devices
6. **Test Coverage**: Currently ~72% (unit suite), target is 85%+
