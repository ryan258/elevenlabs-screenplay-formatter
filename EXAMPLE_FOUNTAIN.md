This snippet demonstrates a minimal Fountain screenplay with headings plus inline character dialogue. You can paste it directly into the app to test the Fountain parser mode.

INT. STARSHIP BRIDGE - NIGHT

CAPTAIN (V.O.)
Stardate 54123.4. Our sensors just picked up a distress beacon.

FIRST OFFICER
It's coming from the uncharted sector. We shouldn't go there.

CAPTAIN
We don't leave people behind. Plot a course.

EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS

NARRATOR: The ship turns toward a storm of neon lightning.

INT. STARSHIP BRIDGE - LATER

TECH OFFICER (O.S.)
Engine output peaking at one-hundred-and-five percent!

CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
Hold her together, Ace. We're almost through.
```

**Tips**

- Fountain format doesn’t require a `Characters:` list; uppercase names automatically become characters.
- Parentheticals like `(V.O.)`, `(O.S.)`, and `(CONT'D)` are handled automatically, and you can choose whether they are spoken via the “Speak Parentheticals” toggle in Project Settings.
