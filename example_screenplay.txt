INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

NARRATOR: It was a cold evening when Detective John Doe met with the key witness to the case.

JOHN DOE: Thank you for coming in today. I know this must be difficult.

MARY SMITH: I want to help. I saw everything that happened that night.

JOHN DOE: Can you tell me what you remember?

MARY SMITH: (nervously) I was walking home from work when I heard shouting. Two men were arguing near the corner store.

JOHN DOE: What time was this?

MARY SMITH: Around nine thirty. Maybe closer to ten.

NARRATOR: The detective leaned forward, listening intently to every word.

JOHN DOE: Did you recognize either of them?

MARY SMITH: No, but one of them was wearing a red jacket. I remember that clearly because it was so bright under the street lights.

JOHN DOE: That's very helpful. Thank you, Ms. Smith.

NARRATOR: And with that crucial detail, the case began to take shape.
