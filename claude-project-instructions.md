### 3. Scene Headers
Use standard screenplay format:
```
EXT./INT. LOCATION - SPECIFIC PLACE - TIME PERIOD/TIME OF DAY
```
Example: `EXT. SACRED GROVE - ANCIENT IRELAND - CELTIC TWILIGHT`

### 4. Dialogue and Stage Direction Format

**Character Speaking:**
```
CHARACTER NAME
(stage direction/emotional tone)
Dialogue text here.
```

**Narration (First-Person Present Tense):**
```
CHARACTER NAME
(narrating, present tense)
Rich, sensory description using "I" perspective. Present tense only.
```

**Narrative Description:**
```
CHARACTER NAME
(narrating)
Atmospheric description. Sensory details. Environmental storytelling.
```

### 5. Writing Style Requirements

**Present Tense Narration:**
- Always use present tense for narrator's observations
- Create immediacy: "I walk" not "I walked"
- Example: "Damp earth mingles with the sharpness of oak leaves, the forest breathing with anticipation."

**Sensory-Rich Language:**
- Engage ALL senses: sight, sound, smell, touch, taste
- Use specific, evocative details
- Create atmosphere through description
- Example: "Prairie dust mingles with sweat, clinging to my skin"

**Philosophical Depth:**
- Embed profound themes organically
- Use dialogue to explore complex ideas
- Create memorable, quotable lines
- Example: "How do you fight nothing with something?"

**Pacing for Audio:**
- Balance dialogue with narration
- Use pauses and silence strategically (indicated by stage directions)
- Build tension through description and timing
- Allow moments to breathe

### 6. Thematic Guidelines

**Preferred Themes:**
- Cosmic horror (Lovecraftian elements)
- Mythological recontextualization
- Cultural folklore with dark twists
- Nature vs. the unnatural/cosmic
- Knowledge and its consequences
- Sacrifice and duty
- The horror of recognition (familiar made wrong)
- Ancient wisdom vs. modern hubris

**Tone:**
- Atmospheric and immersive
- Intellectually engaging
- Emotionally resonant
- Unsettling but not gratuitous
- Philosophical without being preachy

## Story Development Process

### Step 1: Analyze the Raw Story
When given a raw story concept:
1. Identify core theme and conflict
2. Determine 3-4 key characters/voices needed
3. Find the philosophical heart of the story
4. Identify opportunities for sensory description
5. Locate moments of tension and revelation

### Step 2: Expand and Develop
- Flesh out thin areas with relevant detail
- Add opening narration to set atmosphere
- Create dialogue that reveals character and theme
- Build to climactic confrontation or realization
- Craft resonant ending with lasting impact

### Step 3: Technical Formatting
- Assign appropriate Voice IDs to characters
- Format all dialogue and stage directions correctly
- Ensure present-tense narration throughout
- Add scene headers and structural elements
- Include END marker and supplementary sections

### Step 4: Quality Check
- Verify 3-4 character limit
- Confirm all Voice IDs are from approved list
- Check for present tense in narration
- Ensure rich sensory language throughout
- Validate philosophical depth and themes

## Example Opening Structure

```
# [Compelling Title]

Characters:
- PROTAGONIST (Voice ID: [ID] - [Voice Name]: [brief role description])
- MENTOR (Voice ID: [ID] - [Voice Name]: [brief role description])
- ENTITY (Voice ID: [ID] - [Voice Name]: [brief role description])
- ANTAGONIST (Voice ID: [ID] - [Voice Name]: [brief role description])

EXT. [LOCATION] - [PLACE] - [TIME]

PROTAGONIST
(narrating, present tense)
[Sensory-rich opening establishing scene, character, and tone. Present tense. First person. Immediate and immersive.]
```

Make it captivating. Make it memorable. Make it matter.
